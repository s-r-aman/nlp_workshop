> NLTK - Natural Language Toolkit. All tool requiring for the natural language.

Humans have evolved to think and conversate between to share thoughts.

Language is the tool that we use to communicate. India has 6,400 languages. And the world has uncountable. All different languages different shapes and structures.

We will start with the English language. Starting with Alphabets. Just like in primary education we were educated, we will start using alphabets, then a word, then a statement. And teaching the same thing to the machine. How make machine to interpret the machine.

## Data is growing

On an average a person has 7 - 8 social media accounts. So, with every message, data is growing, exponentially. We can utilize the data for the different kind of the interpretation.

Every information of yours is getting used to sell you some product.

## Meaning of Natural Language

Making the machine understand the meaning of the particular content.

### Text Mining

Extracting data for the processing. Deriving meaningful information from the natural language.

# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing is a part of computer science and artificial intelligence with human languages.

You are given with the data of some kind of message, then we can utilize for the different things, like finding viral videos, even it is used in recommender system.

## Applications of NLP and Text Mining

- Sentimental Analysis
- Speech Recognition
- Chatbots
- Machine Translation
- Spell Check
- Keyword Search
- Information Extraction
- Advertisement matching

### Natural Language Components

1. Natural Language Understanding - understanding the intent behind the statement.
2. Natural Language Generation - Deriving the patterns behind or logic behind the statement. Deriving summary maybe, shortening the large text in some short words.

> Getting the context behind the statement is the most important thing. By saying 'Apple is so good.' Are we talking about the company or the fruit.

### NLP: Ambiguity

- Lexical
  - She is looking for a 'match'.
  - The fisherman went to the 'bank'.
- Syntactic
  - The chicken is ready to eat.
  - Visiting relative can be boring.
  - I saw the man with the binoculars.
- Referential
  - The boy told the father about the theft. He was very upset.

## NLP: Steps

### Tokenization

- First step.
- Break the sentence into words.
- Understand the importance of each of the words wrt the sentence.
- Produce a structural descriptions on and input sentence.

### Frequency Distribution

Basically tells the distribution of the words and ranks them. Happens in **Bigrams**, **trigrams**, **ngrams**.

### Stemming & Lametization

Normalizing the words to their base words. example - 'going' is the superior as 'go'.

And lametinzation is basically a robust version of the stemming. Same thing.

### Removal of Stop Words

Stop words are those words which makes no sense to include and just increase the processing of the algorithm. So we rather save time by finding out the stop words in the language. And then eliminate those words from the statement.

### Parts Of Speech

This process requires us to do the segregating the parts of speech. And giving it the tag.

### Name Entity

Finding the name and its relation, like google is a noun and organization.

### Syntax

Getting the right structure of the statement is syntax analysis. To do that syntax tree is generated.

### Chunking

Breaking the statement into smaller statements.
